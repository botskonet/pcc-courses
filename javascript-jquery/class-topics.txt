Topics - Class Eight


- Keeping a site mobile friendly

	(test with Chrome Window Resizer 1.7)

	- General tips:
		- Remember hover doesn't exist
		- Keep files small - faster downloads over unknown network quality
		- Possibly fragment large js/css files if they're not always needed
		- Design for finger sizes. Fitts's law
		- Allow larger text and double-tap zooming
		- Sans-serif fonts are easier to read
	- Choice 1: Progressive Enhancement
		- It's not just for mobile but for better device and feature support
		- Begin with base design and interaction
		- Use media queries, javascript tools for adding styling, features as screen grows
		- It's not just about screen size, but feature support
		- Converting progressive enhancement to contact form
			- Reviewing the css structuring
			- Graceful degradation for the form
			- [Lab]
				- Detect if the browser is firefox
				- Only activate form hide, navigation features if width is 768 or higher
				- The scrollbar bug will bite you: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201101/media_queries_viewport_width_scrollbars_and_webkit_browsers/
			- [Lab]
				- Using Modernizr (http://www.modernizr.com/)
				- Download modernizr (for font-face, rgba, mediaquery)
				- Convert the width to the modernizr tester  http://www.modernizr.com/docs/#mq
			- [Lab]
				- Hide contact form with .js classes instead
				- Use overlay only if rgba is supported
			- [Lab]
				- Convert web font loading to web font conditional
			
			- Alternate ideas:
				- Use rgba feature detection to add in ie opacity support
